There is concrete underneath the CN Tower.

Most people know that in the abstract — someone poured it, obviously, the tower didn't assemble itself out of ambition. But the specific name of the company that supplied it is not on the tower. It's not in the tourist pamphlets. It has never been relevant to anyone standing at the base of that thing looking up.

Lou Vettese ran that company. My grandfather. His concrete is in the ground beneath the most recognizable structure in Canada, and almost nobody knows it.

I think about that a lot.

---

Lou grew up in a family that had crossed an ocean to get to Toronto. The Vetteses were from Monte Cassino — a hilltop town in southern Italy where, from what my family understands, they were not just residents but something closer to anchors. The kind of family a community organizes around without quite naming the arrangement. When the great-grandfather left, that role didn't transfer to anyone. It just stopped existing.

I don't have documentation for this. What I have is a family name that still appears in Monte Cassino, and aunts and uncles who went to look, and the particular way my family carries itself — like people who were once at the center of something and can't quite figure out what went wrong.

Lou's house in Rexdale was a three-lot bungalow in a subdivision. Poured concrete everything. The pool was L-shaped, large enough to actually swim in, with a pool house along one arm that over the years became a kind of rotating home for whichever family member needed a soft landing. The retaining walls into the ravine behind the property — concrete. The house itself — solid as a foundation, which was the point, which was the only thing Lou knew how to build.

Dorothy, my grandmother, filled the interior. Her curation was everywhere: objects, colors, a kind of deliberate beauty that said someone was paying attention to what a home could hold. And they held a lot of people in it. The parties were real. The table was always bigger than necessary.

Seven kids: Grant, Serena, Sirah, Vic, Mike, Mitch, Neta. My dad is Mike, oldest of the younger three.

Lou got an MS diagnosis in his late forties. By his fifties he was in a wheelchair. He was still there, still in the house, still at the center of everything — surrounded by family, surrounded by the village he'd built — and completely unreachable. He shouted a lot. He was not a happy man. Looking back, with everything I now know about how certain kinds of brains work, I think he was probably just autistic and exhausted and trapped in a body that had stopped cooperating, and nobody had language for any of that, least of all him. He didn't know what he'd built. I'm not sure he ever got to feel it.

He passed in the early 2000s.

Here is what I think that house was trying to be, and couldn't quite become.

In Monte Cassino, the Vettese family's role was structural — not political or formal, but the kind of structural that makes a village function. You know who to go to. You know the network radiates from somewhere. You know that what holds the community together isn't a rule, it's a person, or a family, who has accumulated enough trust and relationship that their home is a kind of infrastructure.

You cannot transplant that into a subdivision in Rexdale by replicating the form. Lou built the most solid house on the block. Dorothy curated it into something beautiful. The parties happened. The pool house had a rotating cast of family members who needed a floor to sleep on. Every element of the village was present in miniature.

But a village isn't a house. It's a set of relationships between roles, and those roles need a context that names them before anyone can inhabit them fully. Without that context, the talent goes unrecognized, the energy goes sideways, the impulse to build community keeps firing into a structure that doesn't have the architecture to receive it.

Most of the family has ADHD, undiagnosed, the way an entire generation managed it — through work, through stubbornness, through varying degrees of damage. The pattern recognition that runs in that family is real. What was missing was the container.

I moved a lot as a kid. New schools, new towns, new social ecosystems to decode from scratch every time. By the time I'd settled into any cohort it was mid-year, and I spent the rest of my time in each place trying to understand something that seemed obvious to everyone else: how the in-group worked. What the actual rules were. Why certain people were at the center and others weren't, and whether the mechanism was transferable or just something you had or didn't have.

I never cracked it. And I never stopped thinking about it.

In 1991, at fifteen, I dialed into a BBS called Happy Boat. Something about it felt immediately different from every social environment I'd been in. I drove out to Markham that same night in my dad's truck to meet the guy who ran it, because when something feels real you move toward it.

What was different: there was no machinery. No visual hierarchy, no right hallway to be seen in, no inherited coolness from whoever stood next to you. You showed up as words on a screen. You were interesting or you weren't. You contributed or you didn't. The in-group and out-group dissolved because the signals that maintained them couldn't travel through a phone line.

I went home and built b0bby's World. Three nodes. Three phone lines. Nearly three hundred people who kept finding each other, kept making things together. My sister met her husband on that board. Both fifteen. Two kids now. Still together.

I didn't plan any of that. I built a room. The room made it possible.

---

b0bby's World ran from 1991 to 1994, when the internet arrived and made local BBSes unnecessary — which was true, and also a loss I felt immediately and couldn't explain for years. The form changed. The impulse didn't.

It surfaced again in 2009 as Summer Camp — the first one, at the Estonian community grounds in Elora, Ontario. Eighty-five people. The Toronto party crew, the people I'd been watching find each other in clubs and at cottages and through a decade of shared experience. I knew who needed to be in that room together before any of them would have been able to say it themselves.

I knew because that's the thing I do. That's always been the thing I do.

Kenny showed up dressed as an owl. Nobody asked him to. There was no costume theme. He was just Kenny, and the owl was how he arrived into that space, and by the following year the owl was the official camp logo because the mythology always arrives before you name it.

Fifteen summers. The camp held at a size that could still be a community rather than an event. The specific, patient, largely invisible work of keeping the room from becoming a party and staying a place.

Lou's concrete is under the CN Tower. It will still be there when every company name on every plaque has been forgotten. The foundation is the thing that persists, and the foundation is the thing nobody credits.

He never seemed to know that. Or if he did, he couldn't access whatever satisfaction was supposed to come with it. He was at the center of everything he'd built — the house, the family, the business, the parties — and he couldn't reach any of it. Trapped in the wrong body, in a century that had no language for how his brain worked, surrounded by people who loved him and couldn't get through either.

I understand that inheritance now in a way I didn't for most of my life. Not the concrete specifically — I'm not building in that material. But the impulse to build what holds everything else up. The impulse to make the room that makes other things possible. And the specific danger that comes with it: you can build the room and still not be able to live in it.

The BBS was a room I could live in. Summer Camp is a room I can live in. What I'm building now is infrastructure so that rooms like those can exist at scale — and persist. So that the people who make them don't have to run everything manually in their heads forever. So that the connection survives the platform dying, the organizer burning out, the patriarch going silent in his wheelchair.

The question I kept not being able to answer was how you give the room memory. How the thing that happens when the right people find each other survives past that moment.

That's the question this whole series is trying to answer.

The architecture comes next.
