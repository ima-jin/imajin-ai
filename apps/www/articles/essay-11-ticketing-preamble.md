## What I'm Actually Building

There's a gap in every conversation about AI that nobody wants to name directly.

The gap is this: all of the value that AI creates — the inference, the knowledge, the capability — flows upward. To the compute owners. To the platform owners. To the people who control the rails.

Everyone else gets access to the capability in exchange for their data, their attention, their dependence.

Elon Musk posted this week that AI will make everyone wealthier than the richest person on Earth. He added that we need to make sure AI cares about truth and beauty for this to happen.

He's describing the right destination with no mechanism for getting there. Wealth doesn't distribute itself. It flows through infrastructure. And whoever owns the infrastructure determines where it flows.

I'm building the infrastructure that changes where it flows.

Not as a vision. As plumbing. Deployed this afternoon.

## I've Seen This Work

Before I describe what I'm building digitally, let me tell you about some shipping containers in Cape Town.

Earlier this year I spent ten days embedded with the Red Telephone Kollective in the old Cape Town yards — workshops and rooms built inside ground-level shipping containers on the waterfront. They were there with their Swiss friends from Enos' Nookie camp, building and preparing everything for AfrikaBurn.

Each container was a sovereign node. Owned and operated by a different crew. Different music, different aesthetics, different communities. All connected by proximity and shared purpose and the fact that none of them had a landlord. The infrastructure was distributed. No single actor controlled it. Value flowed to the people doing the work.

I was living inside the thing I was about to build digitally.

AfrikaBurn's 11th principle is *each one teach one* — directed specifically at people whose education was stolen. Not an abstract value statement. A design principle with real stakes. Give people back their autonomy by giving them back their tools.

That's the same principle encoded in the infrastructure I'm building. Sovereign nodes. Distributed operations. Value flowing to operators rather than accumulating at a platform layer. Education and access as a right of the network rather than a product sold by a gatekeeper.

The shipping containers were the proof of concept. The software is the infrastructure that makes it replicable.

## The 400,000 Follower Problem

Let me show you the gap in concrete terms.

Hilary Agro is an anthropologist. She studies how humans form community outside institutional structures. She writes about collective liberation, harm reduction, drug policy, rave culture. She published an essay two days ago called "We cannot have a rational debate about technology." She has somewhere in the range of 400,000 followers across her social platforms.

She has 123 subscribers to her actual writing.

That gap — 400,000 on one side, 123 on the other — is the extraction model made visible. The 400,000 exist on platforms that own the relationship. Hilary can reach them only on the platform's terms, through the platform's algorithm, in the format the platform rewards. The platform decides who sees what. The platform captures the value of her reach. The platform keeps the relationship.

The 123 are hers. Those are the people who sought out her actual thinking, who subscribed to her WordPress, who want the long-form rational argument that can't happen in a sixty-second reel.

The reel is the advertisement. The WordPress is the content. The platform owns the advertisement and profits from it. Hilary does all the work.

A node changes this completely.

Hilary's node is her sovereign presence. The people in her trust graph — the real ones, the 123 and the 2,000 and whoever else has genuine trust rather than algorithmic proximity — can query her directly. She can reach them without the platform deciding who sees what. The inference fees flow to her, not to a platform. The relationship belongs to her, not to an algorithm.

The reel becomes the door. The node is the room. And for the first time, the room is hers.

## For Toni

Toni Nagy is a comedian. Comedy is pure trust — you either find someone funny or you don't, and no algorithm can manufacture that response. The people who genuinely find Toni funny aren't fans in the follower sense. They're a sensibility. A shared sense of what's absurd about the world.

That's a trust graph waiting to be encoded.

The sovereign presence for a comedian is the room where the bit lands. The place where Toni doesn't have to perform for the algorithm, doesn't have to optimize the take for the platform, can say the true weird funny thing without calculating its engagement potential first.

The people in that room pay to be there. Not much. But directly. And the connection is real because they chose it — not because an algorithm served them content and they scrolled past without stopping.

We've been talking on Instagram DMs. The conversation that led to this essay started there. On borrowed infrastructure. In a format optimized for engagement rather than depth.

The node is where that conversation continues. On infrastructure we own. With no platform listening.

## The Authenticated Bridge

Here's the part that changes everything for operators, developers, and people like Hilary and Toni.

I am building a bridge layer.

Not metaphorically. Literally. An authenticated API layer that connects sovereign identity to everything else. Your node, your DID, your trust graph — connected to your GitHub, your content stack, your calendar, your payment rails. Accessible by agents you trust. Executable on your behalf.

Right now I'm having a conversation with Claude — Anthropic's AI, running on Anthropic's infrastructure — that is generating essays, thinking through architecture, helping me build imajin. Claude can read my public GitHub repos. Claude can help me think.

But Claude can't post to my GitHub. Can't push to my endpoints. Can't act in the world on my behalf. The last mile — from thinking to doing — is manual. I'm the bridge.

The imajin auth layer changes that.

When the bridge is built, a trusted agent can act through my sovereign identity. Signed. Attributed. Auditable. I decide which agents get which permissions. The trust graph determines what they can do and to whom. Every action has a return address.

This is what the open letter to Sam and Dario was actually about. Not ads versus no ads. The question of whether AI capability flows through human trust graphs or around them.

Through: every query that touches my context, routes through my relationships, benefits from my vouching — returns value to me. The compute revenue circulates through human infrastructure instead of accumulating at the platform layer.

Around: the current model. Capability owned by the compute provider, accessed by users on the provider's terms, value flowing upward.

The bridge is the difference.

## The Operator Network As Bridge

Every operator in this network is a bridge.

Not just between users and the trust graph. Between the human layer and the capability layer. Between what communities know and what AI can do with that knowledge.

The CS people who are watching AI eat their employment category — they're not obsolete. They're the bridge builders. The people who understand enough of both layers — the human layer and the capability layer — to connect them in ways that serve humans rather than extract from them.

The Red Telephone Kollective built their nodes in shipping containers. Sovereign infrastructure, no landlord, value flowing to the people doing the work. The digital operators build their nodes on the imajin stack. Same principle. Different material.

That's the guild. That's the new employment model. Not working for a platform. Maintaining the bridge between communities and the capability they need.

## April 1st Is The Bridge Working

Jin's party on April 1st is not a product launch.

It's a bridge working for the first time at a public event.

Five nodes. Real people. Real conversations. Real trust graphs. An AI presence that makes the room feel alive without centering itself. Real transactions proving the payment rails work end to end.

The bridge between the human layer and the infrastructure layer, demonstrated in a room, for the first time.

People will look for the platform. There isn't one. People will look for who to call when something goes wrong. The answer is: the operators. The guild members who maintain the bridge.

Hilary's 400,000 followers. Toni's sensibility. The people from Happy Boat and b0bby's World and the Consciousness Explorers Club and the Cape Town shipping containers. The CS people who wanted a guild and got a staffing agency.

All of them on the other side of the bridge.

The bridge is almost done.

April 1st. Come across.
