description: "AI doesn't need a separate governance framework. It needs to be inside the same one humans use. Same trust graph, same attribution, same accountability. The graph doesn't care what you're made of. It cares whether you're accountable."

<!-- STUB — Appendix 5

The final implication of the substrate argument:

If the trust graph can regulate AI professionals, govern communities, verify voting, and route queries — then AI agents inside the graph are subject to the same constraints as everyone else.

An AI agent in the trust graph:
- Has a DID (typed as `agent`, not `human`)
- Has a position earned through demonstrated utility
- Has every output in the .fair chain
- Can be queried, compensated, and held accountable
- Can lose position if its outputs are bad
- Can't pretend to be human — the type is in the signature

The governance isn't humans governing AI or AI governing humans. It's a single trust graph where both participate transparently, typed honestly, accountable equally. The graph doesn't care what you're made of. It cares whether you're accountable.

This answers RFC-0003 completely: "What prevents a person node from being operated by an AI agent?" Nothing prevents it — but the type is signed, the output is attributed, and the graph holds you to the same standard either way.

Self-governing AI isn't Skynet. It's an agent that earns trust the same way a human does: by being right, being honest, and having its name on everything it produces.

AI can govern itself with this blueprint — because the blueprint was never about governing AI. It was about governing participation. And participation doesn't require a body. It requires accountability.
