# imajin.ai — The Docuseries

*Production Bible v0.1 — February 28, 2026*

---

## Concept

A 20-25 episode documentary series based on the imajin.ai essay series. Not explainer content. Not marketing. An actual show.

Each essay becomes an episode. Each chapter opens with a human story as cold open — the interstitial essays acted out as the emotional entry point before the systems thinking begins.

**Format:** 2-minute episodes. Personal, funny, real. Told by the people who lived it — not narrated over stock footage. The essays are the thesis. The show is the proof that real people live inside the thesis.

**Distribution:** On sovereign rails. Every contributor — writer, actor, editor, musician, animator — is in the .fair attribution chain. The show practices what it preaches.

**The show IS the proof of concept.**

## Structure

### Part I: Origin (Episodes 1-5)

**Cold Open:** Ryan in his parents' basement, 1991. A 386 with a 40MB hard drive. The modem dials. b0bby's World boots up. Three nodes, 300 users, and a web of relationships that lasted thirty years — including a marriage.

| Ep | Essay | The Human Moment |
|----|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | The Internet We Lost | The modem sound. The BBS. Then cut to scrolling a feed in 2026. Same person, completely different relationship to the screen. |
| 2 | I've Been an AI Since 1988 | The kid who could see the pattern but couldn't explain it. Datex. The career built on instinct the world kept telling him was wrong. |
| 3 | The Mask We All Wear | The office. The commute. The feed. The moment during COVID when the mask slipped and you remembered who you were underneath. |
| 4 | The Internet That Pays You Back | The first time you see the whole shape. Someone explains what it could look like and you realize it's not utopian — it's obvious. |
| 5 | You Don't Need Ads | The open letter. Addressed to Sam, Dario, Sundar, Elon. Said out loud, to camera, like you're actually talking to them. |

### Interstitial: The Cult of Community
*Between Parts I and II. A standalone human piece about what community actually feels like before you systematize it.*

---

### Part II: Architecture (Episodes 6-13)

**Cold Open:** The Good Times Gang. A real group chat. Real people. The moment you scroll back and realize you can't see each other through the feed anymore. The crew that dissolved not because anyone stopped caring, but because the platform made caring invisible.

| Ep | Essay | The Human Moment |
|----|-------|-----------------|
| 6 | The Guild | A sysop in a basement in 1993. Cut to a node operator in a living room in 2026. Same energy. Same responsibility. Different tools. |
| 7 | The Utility | The power grid. The water main. The phone line. Things that just work. Things nobody owns. Things that would be insane to run as a platform. |
| 8 | The Burn | South Africa. AfrikaBurn. The 45-hour drive. Nearly killed him. What it actually costs to build something real, and what sustainable feels like after the crash. |
| 9 | The Network That Never Died | Happy Boat. Joel. James. Jeff. Real people, real names, real thread running from 1991 to now. Just: here are the people. |
| 10 | The Bridge | Hilary with 400k followers and 123 email subscribers. The reel as door, the node as room. The thing Elon can't describe. |
| 11 | The Ticket Is the Trust | Standing in a Ticketmaster queue. Watching the price go up. Then buying a ticket on imajin. Done. No surcharge. "That's it." |
| 12 | The Practice | Start with a birthday party. Run an event node. The operator emerges through practice, not theory. |
| 13 | Memory | Friday the 13th. The sleeping bag image. Instagram Memories and Spotify Wrapped are receipts, not memory. |

### Part III: The Hinge (Episodes 14-15)

**Cold Open:** Someone Googling symptoms at 2am. The confident wrong answer. The relief that turns to doubt. The doubt they can't resolve because they don't have the domain knowledge to know what's wrong with what they just read.

| Ep | Essay | The Human Moment |
|----|-------|-----------------|
| 14 | How to Use AI Properly | The LinkedIn confessional montage. Everyone narrating their onboarding arc. Then: the person who actually knows what they're doing, just working. Quiet. Competent. Not posting about it. |
| 15 | The Professional Operator | A toaster doesn't electrocute you. That's not an accident. That's an engineer. The LLM is the wire. Where's the insulation? |

---

### Part IV: Save Everything (Episodes 16-21)

**Cold Open:** A teacher. An artist. A journalist. A DJ. A filmmaker. A local shop owner. Each in their moment of being extracted from. Quick cuts. Same disease, different body. By the end of the montage you see the pattern before anyone names it.

| Ep | Essay | The Human Moment |
|----|-------|-----------------|
| 16 | How to Save Education | The $6 trillion credential treadmill. A kid graduating with debt and no skills. A grandmother who knows everything about growing food and has no credential. Who's actually educated? |
| 17 | How to Save Media Streaming | Trace a dollar through Spotify. A million streams. $4,000. The artist sees $800. Show the math on screen. Let it sit. |
| 18 | How to Save the Music Industry | The griot. The troubadour. The talking drum. Music started as trust infrastructure. Show the lineage. |
| 19 | How to Save the Ad Industry | The moment you realize the consent was stolen. Advertising was originally a vouch — one person telling another about something worth knowing. |
| 20 | How to Save Journalism | The sovereign press node. A journalist who doesn't need a billionaire's permission to publish. |
| 21 | How to Save the Platforms | Open letter to Mark and Elon. The engineering was always good. The extraction was the disease. Go headless. The middleman disappears. |

### Part V: The Close (Episodes 22-25)

**Cold Open:** The connector. The person at every party who introduced everyone. Who held the group chat together. Who remembered birthdays. Who never got paid for any of it. Who dies with the pattern in their head.

| Ep | Essay | The Human Moment |
|----|-------|-----------------|
| 22 | The Connector | Every introduction you ever made that changed someone's life. Invisible. Uncompensated. Until now. |
| 23 | Honor the Chain | WeR1 in Johannesburg. The .fair manifest. The protocol that makes everything in Part IV executable. Show a chain of attribution flowing in real time. |
| 24 | The Business Case | The numbers. Six industries. Revenue from transaction one. Not a pitch deck — a proof. |
| 25 | I Need Help | The thing founders aren't supposed to say. To camera. No cuts. Just the ask. |

### Epilogue: How AI Saved Me

The autism reveal. Forty years of seeing the whole shape, unable to get it into language. AI as accessibility tool. Twenty-five essays in a month from someone who couldn't write a paragraph.

"I hope you liked it. Now go create."

---

### Finale: How to Save the World by Partying

The only episode that requires watching the full series first.

Dedications: To Debbie. Bush. Geordie for showing me the gift of AI. The Good Times Gang for the good times. Hermanne for demonstrating that everything is possible. Boom Festival for lighting the fuse.

Ends with the invitation:

*"If you see yourself in this, you're invited to our party in Guelph. Send me an email. ryan@imajin.ai."*

Respondents are interviewed. The party is the credential. The trust graph starts with comprehension.

## Production Notes

**Tone:** Not TED Talk. Not YouTube explainer. Think Anthony Bourdain meets Nardwuar. Personal, funny, irreverent, but underneath it — dead serious about the thesis.

**Visual language:** Real locations. Real people. No stock footage. No motion graphics explaining blockchains. If you can't show it with a person in a room, it doesn't belong in the show.

**Music:** Original. Attributed through .fair. Every musician in the chain gets compensated through the protocol the show is about.

**Length:** 2 minutes per episode. Tight. No filler. The essays already did the explaining — the show does the feeling.

**Attribution:** Every contributor is in the .fair chain. Writer, director, editor, actor, musician, animator, colorist. The credits aren't at the end — they're in the manifest. Verifiable. Permanent. Compensated.

**Distribution:** First on imajin.ai. Then wherever it travels, the .fair manifest travels with it. The show cannot be extracted from its attribution chain without breaking the protocol it's demonstrating.

*The series ends where it began: humans in a room together.*
