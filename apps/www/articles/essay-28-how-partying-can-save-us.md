You've made it.

Twenty-seven essays. The extraction model. The trust graph. The .fair protocol. Six industries. The connector. The ask. The autism reveal. If you read them in order, you've spent somewhere between four and eight hours inside an argument I've been building for thirty years and writing for six months.

I owe you the answer to the question you've probably been sitting with since somewhere around essay four.

What does any of this have to do with partying?

Everything. It has always been everything. I just needed twenty-seven essays to earn the right to say that without sounding like a person who went to one too many festivals and came back with a theory.

## What Capitalism Did to the Coolest Culture We Ever Built

Let me tell you about what the rave was before it became a product.

Not the legal version. Not the ticketed, branded, Instagram-documented, VIP-table, bottle-service festival with the Ticketmaster surcharge and the lineup of DJs who fly in, play ninety minutes, and fly out. Before all of that.

The rave was illegal. The location was a secret distributed by phone chain the morning of the event. Admission was whatever you could give. The music went all night because the night was the point — not the headliner, not the set, but the continuous movement of a room full of people through something together. Nobody owned the culture. The DJ read the room. The room gave back. The thing that happened between them wasn't a product. It was a conversation.

It was the most welcoming large-scale human gathering most of the people in those rooms had ever experienced. Queer, straight, working class, educated, every color, every background — flattened to a common condition by the music and the dark and the shared commitment to being present. You couldn't perform your way through it. Either you were there or you weren't. The room knew the difference.

What happened next was entirely predictable and entirely avoidable.

The promoters figured out it could be monetized. The venues went legal. The tickets appeared. Then the tiers — general admission, VIP, platinum. Then the brands. Then the festival format, which turned a continuous communal experience into a consumer product with a lineup and a stage and an audience facing forward. Then Ticketmaster. Then the streaming deal. Then the DJ as celebrity, untethered from the room, playing the same set in every city because the set is the brand and the brand is the revenue stream.

Every step was celebrated as the scene growing up. Every step was the scene being captured.

The music got louder and the community got quieter. The experience got more spectacular and more expensive and less yours. And the people who built it — the DJs who read the rooms before there were stages, the organizers who ran the illegal parties on nothing, the community that showed up and made it real — got handed a ticket stub and told to be grateful for access to the thing they built.

You know this story. We've told it six different ways across six industries. Extraction is extraction. The disease doesn't care what it's eating.

## What the Good Ones Got Right

I've been studying this the way I study everything — obsessively, across years, in rooms rather than in books.

**Boom Festival**, Portugal. Every two years on a lake in the Alentejo. I went expecting a festival and found something closer to a functioning society. Forty thousand people. Multiple stages, but also healing centers, art installations, spaces for children, spaces for elders. Spaces designed specifically for the hard conversations that happen after the hard nights.

What Boom got right that almost no one else has: intergenerational design. Children present. Elders present. The full range of human life in one space, because that's what a village looks like. Culture isn't real until all generations can participate in it. A party that only works for people between twenty-two and thirty-five isn't culture. It's a demographic product.

I watched a grandmother and her granddaughter dance together at sunrise. The grandmother had been coming since the nineties. The granddaughter was maybe eight. Neither of them was performing for anyone. They were just in it, together, in a way that most people in that grandmother's generation have never been able to share with their grandchildren and most children in that granddaughter's generation have never experienced in their lives.

That image is the whole argument.

**Sisyphos**, Berlin. A permanent space in a former factory complex. This is the other thing almost no one gets right: permanence. Most party culture is ephemeral by design — the event, the weekend, the season. Sisyphos is a place. The culture has been accumulating there for years. The staff know the regulars. The regulars know each other. The rooms have history.

What Sisyphos understood: you cannot build culture on a temporary surface. You need somewhere the culture can accumulate. Memory requires a container.

They also built something I've never seen anywhere else: keta booths. Small, discreet spaces positioned at the edges of the dancefloor. No signage that would shame anyone. Just: if you need to sit down and process something, here is a place. The architecture acknowledged that people are having real experiences in these rooms — not just consuming entertainment — and designed around that reality with dignity rather than denial.

**AfrikaBurn**, South Africa. The Karoo desert, every year in April. I was there in 2025 with the Red Telephone Kollective — a group of Cape Town crews who had built their camps in sovereign shipping containers. Each container owned and operated by a different crew. All of them part of shared infrastructure. No landlord extracting rent from the culture they were making.

I was living inside the thing I was building digitally. I didn't fully understand that until I was back in Toronto.

AfrikaBurn has an eleventh principle — the official Burning Man principles stop at ten. The eleventh is *each one teach one*, directed specifically at people whose education was stolen. Not a value statement. A design principle with stakes. Knowledge moves through the community not from a stage but person to person, through relationship, through trust.

Enos' Nookie camp: named after Enos the space monkey, first creature to survive re-entry from space. Two chambers — inside, low volume, intimate, the conversation you need to have after the night you just had; outside, a massive sound system for ecstatic release. The architecture serves both the quiet and the loud without one compromising the other. The design is the culture.

## The Owl in the Dark

In 2009, Kenny showed up to the first Summer Camp dressed as an owl.

Nobody asked him to. There was no costume theme. He was just Kenny, and the owl was how he arrived into that space, and the room recognized something in it immediately — not as a joke, not as a bit, but as a real thing. A character with weight. A presence that named something about what we were trying to do in that space.

The following year, the owl was the official Summer Camp logo. The mythology had arrived before anyone named it. That's how mythology works — it shows up dressed as something else and you don't recognize it until later.

That was fifteen years ago. Eighty-five people at the Estonian community grounds in Elora, Ontario. The Toronto party crew, the people I'd been watching find each other for a decade. I knew who needed to be in that room together before any of them would have said it themselves.

Every year since. The camp held at a size that could still be a community — deliberately, sometimes painfully, held below the threshold where it becomes an event. The difference between a community and an event is whether you know who's in the room. Whether the room is legible to itself.

Kenny's presence in that space — not just the owl costume, but Kenny, the mythology he carries, the specific way he holds space for the absurd and the sacred simultaneously — became what I started calling the Nookie. Inspired by AfrikaBurn's Enos, evolved for Elora. Two chambers: an inner nest where the conversation happens, where people come down and integrate and find each other in the quieter register; an outer ring where the music lives, where ecstatic release happens. Neither compromising the other.

The meta layer is where whatever is being built gets tested in real conditions by real people who trust each other. The party rig as proof of concept. The community as the lab.

## Summer Camp 15

August 2026. Elora, Ontario.

Not a festival. A cultural R&D lab. Fifteen years of iteration in a single, deliberate prototype of what it could become if we let it.

The vision isn't bigger. It's deeper. Permanent infrastructure built with ecological care. Modular zones that expand and contract with the rhythm of the weekend. Artist-led collaborative creation instead of performance consumption — the difference between a room where people make things together and a room where people watch things happen to them.

The economic model is an experiment in itself. Sliding scale: two hundred to two thousand dollars, self-selected, based on what you'd spend on a five-day holiday. Nobody is asked to justify their number. The internal economy runs on a combination of ticket revenue, labor hours, and something closer to gift — contribution recognized and reciprocated through systems that make the exchange visible rather than dissolving it into the vibe.

Artists are paid. In space, in food, in a share of whatever gets built. The person who held the room together is credited for holding it. The DJ who read the crowd at 4am is acknowledged for the specific, irreplaceable skill that is. The photographer whose shots became the memory of the weekend is attributed to those shots. The .fair chain runs through the whole thing.

What I want Summer Camp 15 to be is the first time all of this exists in the same place simultaneously — the sovereign infrastructure underneath, the cultural practice on top, the economic model making contribution legible, the mythology doing what mythology does. A demonstration. A prototype. The argument made physical and danced.

## What Partying Actually Is

Here is what I think we forget, or were never taught, or had extracted from us along with everything else.

Partying isn't indulgence. It isn't escape. It isn't the opposite of serious.

It is how humans have always rehearsed freedom. How we practice grief and ecstasy in proximity, so that neither destroys us when we meet them alone. How we remember that the body is real and the present moment is real and the person next to you is real in ways that no feed, no highlight reel, no engagement-optimized notification will ever make real.

Every culture that has ever existed has had ritual gathering. The form changes — the bacchanal, the harvest festival, the church social, the block party, the rave, the sunrise set at a festival by a lake in Portugal. The function doesn't. We need to be in rooms together. We need to move together. We need to have the experience of being held by something larger than our individual selves, and then return to our individual selves changed by it.

The extraction model understood this and monetized it. It turned ritual into content, community into audience, participation into consumption.

The answer is not to stop gathering. The answer is to build infrastructure worthy of why we gather.

That's what twenty-seven essays have been about. That's what imajin is. That's what .fair is. That's what the trust graph is — not a technical architecture, but the digital form of the thing that has always happened when people find each other in the right room and decide to keep showing up.

The sovereign internet isn't an end in itself. It's the infrastructure underneath the dance floor.

## The Invitation

Summer Camp 15. August 2026. Elora.

If you've read this far — all of it, or enough of it, or even just this — you have some sense of what we're building and why. The infrastructure exists. The protocol exists. Jin's party happened on April 1st and the network held.

Now we build the village.

Not a product. Not a festival. Not a brand experience with a lanyard and a sponsor stage. A village — the one that crossed an ocean and forgot what it was for, rebuilt with everything we've learned since.

Bring your art. Your tools. Your story. Build something that lives beyond the weekend.

The owl is watching.
