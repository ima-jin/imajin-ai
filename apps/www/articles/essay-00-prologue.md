My name is Ryan. I've been online since 1988. I've watched this whole thing happen in real time — the wonder, the promise, the slow capture, the extraction, the exhaustion.

I am writing essays about what comes next.

Here's why.

Because it's not as dark as everyone thinks.

What comes after the AI panic, after the platform exhaustion, after the extraction model finally collapses under its own weight — it looks a lot like the late 80s and 90s. Real communities. Real money going to real people. Wisdom that actually counts for something. But this time with skin in the game. This time with memory. This time it scales.

I know what that world feels like because I built a small version of it. In 1991, at fifteen years old, I ran a BBS out of my parents' basement. Three phone lines. Three modems. Nearly three hundred people who kept finding each other, kept making things together, kept forming bonds that lasted thirty years.

But before that — before I built anything — I drove out to Markham in a jet-black 1983 Ford F150 Flare Side with a red pinstripe to meet strangers from a board called Happy Boat. The truck was trash. It looked amazing. I drove it out the same night I first dialed in, because that's how it worked. You felt something real and you moved toward it.

That drive is the whole thing. That's what skin in the game looks like.

I was a real person going to meet real people. If I turned out to be terrible — or they did — we'd all have to live with it. The accountability was built into the architecture. Not by design. By reality. You couldn't hide behind a screen name when you were sitting in someone's living room.

The internet broke that. Anonymous handles. Throwaway accounts. Platforms that made money when you were angry. Thirty years of optimizing the humanity out of connection.

And the communities suffered for it. Not just the ones that went toxic — the ones that never got to form at all. The third spaces closed. The platforms that replaced them turned out to be stages, not rooms. You can have fifty thousand followers and eat dinner alone.

But something is shifting. The tools that scared everyone are the same tools that finally make the better version buildable again. The post-AI world isn't bleak. It's intimate. It's local. It's owned.

I've spent six months writing about it. Twenty essays. The internet we lost, the infrastructure we need, the communities we can rebuild, the economy that emerges when wisdom finally gets rewarded the way it used to be.

It'll take you four or five hours to read them all. I think it's worth it.
