My name is Ryan. I've been computing since 1988, online since 1991. I've watched this whole thing happen in real time — the wonder, the promise, the slow capture, the extraction, the exhaustion.

---

It's not as dark as everyone thinks.

What comes after the AI panic, after the platform exhaustion, after the extraction model finally runs out of people willing to be extracted — it looks a lot like the late 80s and 90s. Real communities. Real money going to real people. Wisdom that actually counts for something. But this time with skin in the game. This time with memory. This time it scales.

I know what that world feels like because I built a small version of it. In 1992, at sixteen, I ran a BBS out of my parents' basement. Three phone lines. Three modems. Nearly three hundred people who kept finding each other, kept making things together, kept forming bonds that lasted thirty years.

But before that — before I built anything — I found Happy Boat.

I'd dialed into maybe ten boards in my local calling area by then. They were all different, all fine. I'd seen the number listed in Toronto Computes! and liked the name. When I connected, the login screen hit me before I'd even created an account: a bunch of funny characters on a boat, all waving. Advanced goofy ASCII art. Completely committed to the bit. I remember thinking — these are people who understand.

I made an account and looked around for a few minutes. Then Seth, the sysop, broke into the chat. He wanted to know how I'd found the number. I told him the newspaper. He asked what I thought. I probably said something like "this place looks amazing." We talked for a few minutes and then he said: "You want to meet up?"

It was 11pm. He was in Markham. I was in Rexdale. We picked a Country Style Donuts somewhere in the middle.

I didn't drink coffee yet. I probably had a hot chocolate. I have no idea what we talked about. But I drove out to meet a stranger from a BBS at a donut shop at 11 o'clock at night because the ASCII art felt right and the sysop asked.

That's what skin in the game looks like. That's the whole thing.

I was a real person going to meet a real person. If I turned out to be terrible — or he did — we'd both have to live with it. The accountability was built into the architecture. Not by design. By reality. You couldn't hide behind a screen name when you were sitting across a table from someone.

The internet broke that. Anonymous handles. Throwaway accounts. Platforms that made money when you were angry. Thirty years of optimizing the humanity out of connection.

And the communities suffered for it. Not just the ones that went toxic — the ones that never got to form at all. The third spaces closed. The platforms that replaced them turned out to be stages, not rooms. You can have fifty thousand followers and eat dinner alone.

But something is shifting. The tools that scared everyone are the same tools that finally make the better version buildable again. The post-AI world isn't bleak. It's intimate. It's local. It's owned.

Twenty essays. The internet we lost, the infrastructure we need, the communities we can rebuild, the economy that emerges when wisdom finally gets rewarded the way it used to be.

Four or five hours to read them all. Worth it.
