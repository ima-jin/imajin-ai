title: "Attribution, Not Protection"
subtitle: "We don't need to prevent copying. We need to stop laundering attribution."
description: "Everything is derivative of something else. The problem was never copying — it was collapsing the chain of who contributed what. .fair preserves the chain. The cultural shift from extraction to attribution repairs a huge wrong."

<!-- STUB — Essay 24

The arc:
- Everything is derivative. Always has been. That's not the problem.
- The problem is the collapse of the attribution chain. Spotify, Facebook, AI training — same mechanism, different scales.
- .fair doesn't try to lock things down. It preserves the chain through every transformation.
- The cultural shift: from "how do I protect my content" to "how do I use tools that carry my contribution forward."
- When attribution flows, value flows. Repair the chain, repair the economics.
- You don't ban the behavior. You make the honest path more rewarding than the dishonest one.

Follows 23 (professional shielding): the mechanism of responsible practice IS attribution preservation.

Reference: Thaler v. Perlmutter — SCOTUS potentially taking up first AI authorship case (Feb 27, 2026).
Question: "Can works outputted by an AI system without direct human authorial contribution be copyrighted?"
This is the wrong question. Copyright asks "who owns the output?" — .fair asks "who's in the chain?"
If SCOTUS rules AI output isn't copyrightable, it strengthens the attribution thesis: the legal system can't protect you, but the protocol can track you. The only way to establish provenance for AI-assisted work becomes attribution chains, not copyright claims.
