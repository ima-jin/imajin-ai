## THE DEEP PAST: Lineage & Inheritance

**~1920s**
Great-grandfather leaves Monte Cassino (small Italian hill town), emigrates to Scotland with his Italian partner. He had been the cultural centerpoint of that village — an organizer, a connector, a hub. Circumstances of departure unknown but presumed cataclysmic. He carries the architecture of the village in his bones but arrives with no soil for it to root in.

**Scotland → Toronto (mid-20th century)**
The family line migrates again. Phantom-limb pattern: build big, gather people, create structure — but without the shared mythology that made the original village work.

**Lou & Dorothy, Toronto**
Ryan's paternal grandparents. Seven kids. A big house in Toronto as the center of a micro-universe. A concrete business. A family unit with the complementary skill sets of a village guild — builders, feelers, organizers — but operating inside colonial-capitalist logic rather than circular community logic. The structure survived. The soul splintered.

## GENESIS & EARLY FORMATION

**Friday November 14, 1975**
Born. Toronto.

**1987**
First contact with computers. A "portable" IBM computer with an 8 inch monochromatic screen — the kind people left on the curb. His dad always hauling them home. No manuals, no formal training. Then an Atari 130XE. Learns to code by copying programs line-by-line from *Compute!* magazine. Methodology: transcribe exactly, run it, debug by comparison, fix, run again. Pattern recognition and iteration as the foundational mode. Not computer science — something closer to how AI actually works.

**~1990–1991 — Happy Boat BBS**
Before b0bbys World, there was Happy Boat. The first BBS he ever dialed into and stayed. It was *weird* — and that was the hook. Locked in from the first session. Drove out to Markham that same night to meet the sysop. Three sysops: **Seth**, **Archemedies**, and **Jambalaya**. Drove there in a 1983 Ford F150 Flare Side pickup, jet black with a red pinstripe. His first commuter vehicle, before the VW Fox. The truck was trash. It looked amazing.

Happy Boat is where he learned what a BBS could be. Where he first *felt* it. Then he went and built b0bbys World because he knew what the thing was supposed to feel like. Seth and the Happy Boat crew are still in the network. Thirty-five years later, operators on the sovereign infrastructure. The thread runs straight through.

*The network never died. It just went dormant waiting for the infrastructure to catch up to what it already knew how to be.*

**1991–1994 — b0bbys World BBS**
Age 15 turning 16 when it starts. 386 with a 40mb HD. grows to 3 nodes, 3 phone lines, 3 modems. A music distribution hub for the demoscene — first featuring music by the group MAZURkA, later Chill Productions. ~300 users. Starts local, spreads nationally, then internationally. People from Europe dialing in. Collaborations forming across phone lines. His sister *Hot Tamale* meets her husband *Anarchy Tech* on the BBS — both 15, two adult kids now, still together. Three nodes. Three people online at once. The scarcity creates intimacy. The architecture creates bonds that last 30+ years.

**Early 1994 — BBS ends**
b0bby's World winds down. People switch to dial-up internet. IRC arrives. No reason to dial a BBS when you can be on the actual internet. He gets on it too.

**1994 — Extra semester of high school**
Stays to improve grades for college.

**1995 — Humber College, briefly**
Enrols. Gets a $2,000 gift from his grandmother. Uses it to buy a 1987 VW Fox to get to school in the suburbs. One semester in: too abstract, too slow, too disconnected from making things that actually work. Doesn't return.

**1995, Summer — Datex, Oakville**
Broke. Not going back to college. His aunt introduces him to her autistic neighbours in Oakville: **Jim and Lori Dawson**, who run a telecom rebilling and phone bill pricing analysis business called **Datex**. Jim writes OCR software to read phone bills. Ryan starts doing data entry — fixing errors in the OCR process. The work before the work that matters.

**1996 — ISDN at Datex**
Ryan and the other devs push the business onto ISDN lines. Real always-on internet. Everything opens up.

**1997–1999 — Learning to build, Datex**
First teacher: **Marc Carrafiello**, who teaches him Basic. From Basic they build compiled Visual Basic EXEs — administrative tools for Datex clients to manage their profiles and phone bill data. The business had previously maintained an installed client application requiring the dev to go onsite. Now they control the build in the form of a web page. Revolutionary in the most literal sense. He doesn't know he's inventing a new deployment model. He's just solving the problem in front of him.

**1999 — Organic Toronto**
Gets tired of living in Oakville. Finds a job in Toronto. Gets hired as a front-end dev by his second teacher: **Chris Bennett** at **Organic Toronto**. Learns digital media properly. Meets some of the smartest and most creative people of his life. The education he actually needed — just not in a classroom.

---

## THE CAREER: Pattern Recognition at Scale

**1999 — First Toronto parties, Industry Night Club**
City life begins. First real club culture in Toronto.

**1999–2003 — Organic and the digital media years**
Building the foundations of a career on pattern recognition. Front-end development, the vocabulary of the early web, digital media. The methodology unchanged since 1988 — find the pattern, adapt it, run it, fix the errors, run again.

**2003 — First world trip**
Sells his condo. Travels for 10 months with his first wife **Katherine**. Route: England → Spain → Morocco → India → Thailand → Malaysia → Singapore → Australia → New Zealand. Maintains a blog at **spaz.com/rtw** — journaling and transcribing handwritten notes, uploading pictures from internet cafes along the way. Family follows in real time. Writes an **EXIF image parser by hand** to pull metadata from pictures off their Canon G4. Pre-WordPress. Pre-everything. Just code solving a problem.

**2005 — First festival, England / Ibiza**
First taste of European festival culture. The seed.

**2005–2007 — Contracting**
Back in Toronto. Various gigs. Tries to start a business. Not good at it yet.

**2007 — First blinky light installation**
A friend buys an old church intending to turn it into a community center (never does). Ryan builds his first controllable LED installation: programmable LEDs inside a mass of balloons at an event in the space. The lighting practice begins. The idea that light should live permanently somewhere — that's in there from the start.

**2007–2009 — Ethan Allen contract**
Mega. Builds their entire consumer-facing website and administrative back end. The catalogue runs on AS400 and COBOL — he outsources that part (the only time he encounters COBOL and he's not starting now). Delivers everything else.

**2008 — First Burning Man**
First time on the playa.

**2009 — Burning Man + Summer Camp 1**
Returns to Burning Man. Same summer: **Summer Camp 1** at the Estonian grounds in Elora. 85 people — the Toronto party crew, people who share the same values around consumption and celebration. Fully catered. A parallel life, hidden from family and the straight world. Ephemeral, over-budget, beautiful, gone by Monday. Kenny shows up dressed as an owl. The following year the owl becomes the official camp logo. The mythos is born without anyone naming it.

**2010 — Buys a house. Burning Man. Separates from Katherine.**
Contracting for friends — a luxury real estate business and an autos publishing website with industry journalists. The autos site never fully takes off but the technology is interesting. The marriage ends.

**Late 2010 / 2011 — Debbie**
Meets **Debbie**. They get together late 2010 / early 2011. She becomes the co-architect and co-lead of everything that follows — every Burning Man, every Last Resort build, every Summer Camp from SC2 onward. Where Ryan brings the creative vision, the pattern recognition, the manic generative energy — Debbie brings the organisational anchor. She is the reason the camp scales without imploding. She keeps a lid on the growth that would otherwise spiral. Without her the events don't run, don't hold, don't land. The 175-person dinner that ends every camp exists because she makes it possible.

The builds are also where the friction lives. Ryan's autistic wiring means he needs to turn his brain completely off between creative surges — and the builds are high-demand environments where people need answers and decisions constantly. The explosive outbursts center on a specific trigger: being asked the wrong questions at the wrong moment. *"Why are you asking me THIS right NOW?"* — when what he needs is space and silence and no inputs. In the middle of a build, that space is almost impossible to find. Debbie absorbs a lot of this. So does everyone around him during the frantic pack-in and pack-out rhythm.

They marry in 2018.

**2011 — Burning Man**
With Debbie. First Burn together.

**2013 — Last Resort Theme Camp, Burning Man**
Last Resort scores the last sound camp spot at the end of the outer ring — highly coveted. Ryan and Debbie co-leading the build. The Burning Man practice deepens: how to run a sound camp, how to manage a crew, how to build something temporary with real intention.

**2012–2017 — Flight Center**
Burned out. Totally bored. Five years of going through the motions.

**2015 — First trip to Berlin**
First time at Sisyphos and the Berlin club scene. With Debbie. Returns seven more times over the following decade.

**2015 — Last Resort returns to Burning Man**
Robot Heart wins the coveted corner spot over Last Resort.

**2017 — Last Resort vs. Robot Heart**
Last Resort gets the corner spot over Robot Heart. They aren't happy about it.

**2017–2025 — Kensington Tours / Trip Arc**
Takes the job to break out of the Flight Center rut. Excels — becomes the subject matter expert on the legacy booking platform, the person who understands it better than anyone alive. The situation is extractive and ugly from the beginning: not great pay relative to input/labour, constantly having to fit in the mold of "proving" merit. results don't seem to matter. He moves to the marketing team in the last year for a change of pace but lands in a more ruthless framework - knowledge hoarding, silos, a VP who treats information as territory.  A new dev (ryans direct report) spends ten months failing to build the bridge between the legacy API and the new website. The knowledge is in Ryan's head. The corporate architecture makes it inaccessible. The company pays for ten months of spinning wheels as a direct consequence.

**2010–2019 — Summer Camps 2–11**
Annual events. SC2 in 2010 through SC11 in 2019. Ryan and Debbie as co-leads throughout. The event grows steadily — more people, more elaborate production, more lighting, more catered dinner ambition. Consistently over budget. The Estonian Summer Camp in Elora holds it all. The lighting practice develops alongside with the discipline that any fixture must eventually generate revenue outside the camp context. The underlying pattern never changes: arrive frantic, unpack, blow everything out, scoop it back into a truck by Monday night. Ephemeral. Two parallel lives maintained for years.

The autistic outbursts happen during builds. The wrong question at the wrong moment — someone needing a decision when Ryan's brain is fully saturated and just needs to power down — triggers explosive responses that leave damage. Debbie absorbs it. The crew absorbs it. It's part of the texture of the build. Nobody has language for it yet.

**January 2021 — The Fungeon**
Rich and Julie open up most of their basement for Ryan to use as a workshop. The decision: give lights a really strong go. Stop treating the lighting practice as a side project and build it properly.

The shop is still there. It's the first permanent space. And it immediately illustrates the core problem with every space he's ever built in: it gets used for parties. New Year's events. Other gatherings. The Fungeon flips between workshop and party venue and back. Each flip costs something — the setup, the cleanup, the getting it back into work mode. The exhaustion of the reset is the same exhaustion as the Monday after Summer Camp, just compressed into a weekend. Ryan now pushes hard to keep it as a workshop only. The parties are not worth the cost of losing the work mode.

*The Fungeon is the thesis in miniature: a permanent creative space is only valuable if it stays a permanent creative space. The moment it becomes an event venue it stops being a workshop. You cannot have both without infrastructure that separates them. This is exactly what SC15 would solve — and exactly what makes the build-and-burn model so corrosive.*
The extraction machine turns down to nothing. People go home. And then: an explosion of creative output unlike anything in recent memory. Musicians, producers, artists — suddenly with time and space and no commute and no events to prep for. The music that comes out of this period is extraordinary. Ryan notices. Files it.

**2021 — Allotapallooza, Claytonia**
No official Summer Camp — COVID limits still in effect. But: a gathering of 25 people at **Claytonia**, the family hunting property of Laura Pallotta's partner Clay. Occasion: **Laura Pallotta's 51st birthday**, celebrated as her 50th — because the actual 50th was lost to lockdown and that debt needed to be honoured.

Ryan plays a six-hour DJ set. Records it. All that music that had been created during lockdown, when everyone was home with space and time and nowhere to be — it pours through the set. One of his favourite sets ever. The revelation lands hard: *this is what we can create when the extraction machine is turned off.* Not just musicians in their home studios — but the culture that gathers around it, the listening, the dancing, the six hours of someone pouring everything they've absorbed into a room of 25 people who have all been starving for exactly this.

The argument for permanent space lives in this night. Not as theory. As lived proof. 

**2023 — Summer Camp 13**

**2024 — Summer Camp 14**
Ryan convinces the group to shift to an every-two-years cadence going forward — alternating with Boom Festival. The logic is capacity: the build-and-burn rhythm makes annual events impossible to sustain. The deep irony being that if they had permanent infrastructure on the land, they'd have the capacity to do it every single year. The frantic pack-in/pack-out is the thing consuming all the capacity. The ephemerality is the problem masquerading as the format.

The survey this year returns disheartening results. Both the making of it and the receiving. Ryan is seriously questioning whether to continue at all. Fourteen years of giving away enormous creative labour to a small, exclusive group. The vision was always something larger. The container has stayed small.

## THE BREAKING POINT & DIAGNOSIS

**December 2024**
Autism and ADHD diagnosis — largely sought out because the patterns between him and Debbie seemed unsolvable. Everything that never quite fit gets a name: the pattern recognition without formal comprehension, the need for an initial handhold into new stacks, the compulsive cross-domain connection-making, the way systems "talk" to him before he can articulate why. He's open about it at work. Nobody knows what to do with it.

What the diagnosis also reveals, slowly and painfully: he and Debbie may be fundamentally incompatible in ways that aren't reconcilable. The autistic thinking patterns that have defined his whole life — the ones that made the BBS work, that built the lighting practice, that solved the bridge problem — seem to have opened a chasm in their relationship that gets wider the more clearly he sees it. The tension in their social group has been building too. Fourteen years of building together. A marriage. The SC co-lead relationship. All of it under new light, and the new light is unsparing.

He doesn't have the answer to this yet. He's carrying it.

## THE ACTIVATION SEQUENCE: March–August 2025

**March 2025 — Skyland / Cloud 9 Villa / The Prehistoric Dune, Garden Route (5 days)**
These are all the same place. Cloud 9 Villa sits at the very top of a prehistoric dune outside Sedgefield, which is the same area as George on the Garden Route. One location. Five days. Ryan and Debbie both there. The WeR1 network — ~80 strangers, many of them new. The staff had set up tents and party decoration. Other attendees brought their own art and deco. There was a full-time cook with kitchen staff, plus other paid help throughout.

A shamanic medicine weekend: fully guided ritual, deeply intentional, held well. Real ceremony. Rare. Also: the household help dressed in party outfits. Performative costumed faces. Unresolved labour dynamics made visible. The hosts have invited people from other cultures to witness their world. They cannot locate the source of their own discomfort. Possibly a psychotic break for one of them. Mentally anguishing to watch — not because anyone is malicious, but because the injustice is structural and invisible to the people perpetuating it.

South Africa is a country years ahead of most in its formal reconciliation process — and simultaneously a country full of towns of whiteness on the outskirts, where land is still largely held by white families, and the townships are being "modernized" while the fundamental power structure persists. Being inside a private estate ceremony with costumed help makes the contradiction impossible to ignore. The dune is prehistoric. The injustice is recent. Both are right there.

*Design principle extracted: Medicine alone isn't enough. The culture surrounding it matters more. Ritual integrity requires the same care in its outer architecture as its inner ceremony.*

**March–April 2025 — Johannesburg (~3 weeks)**
Flies from George to Joburg. Stays at the home of **Geordie** (co-founder of the WeR1 music streaming platform). Sits with their dev team every day. Doesn't have language for what he's there to do. Geordie seems to understand there's something important to draw out even when Ryan can't articulate it.

Two things hit simultaneously: watching the team work fluidly with AI-assisted tools (Cursor, Warp) — and realising how far autogen has come while he was buried in a legacy system at his corporate job, missing the entire revolution. His brain is on fire. He can make code contributions in just days on a stack he's never been comfortable with. The bottleneck that defined his career has dissolved.

Also: he's scattered. The diagnosis is five months old. The grief about the wasted corporate years is real. He cannot contribute as effectively as he senses he could.

Throughout the South Africa trip he is still nominally the technical leader on the Kensington project — but completely checked out. Not touching the bridge problem at all.

**~May 12, 2025 — Returns to Toronto**
Home from South Africa. The full trip: Garden Route → Joburg → Cape Town → AfrikaBurn → Cape Town → Toronto.

Back in Toronto, with the new AI toolset fully internalised from watching the WeR1 team, he finally looks at the bridge problem. The project manager's message: *"Dude. I don't think he's got this."* Ten days. Command-line driven, AI-assisted, the same recursive loop since 1988. Solved. The bottleneck of his entire career dissolves in Toronto, with tools he learned to trust in Joburg.

**May 22, 2025 — Fired**
The Monday the new website is supposed to launch. Let go. Had been maneuvering for it. Receives 37 weeks severance. The bridge was already shipped.

**Early–Mid April 2025 — Cape Town, Noordhoek (~10 days pre-AfrikaBurn)**
After Joburg, travels to Cape Town. Stays at the guest house of friends **Velten Doering and Marai** in **Noordhoek** with his partner Debbie. Rents a small car. Every day: drive from Noordhoek to the old shipping yards in Cape Town where the **Red Telephone Kollective** and their Swiss friends from Enos' Nookie camp have their open-air studios — workshops and rooms built inside ground level shipping containers. Ten days embedded with this collective, building and preparing everything to take into AfrikaBurn.

Being with the Red Telephone Kollective deepens the understanding that began at Skyland — but from the other direction. Here the injustice is not hidden inside a ceremony; it's just the landscape, unignorable. A huge part of the disparity in South Africa comes from the complete lack of education that has been systematically stolen from people. Even if they are given access to tools and money, they lack the foundational education to build with it. Autonomy without education is a trap. The land theft and the knowledge theft are the same project.

AfrikaBurn has an 11th principle: **each one teach one**. It's not an abstract value statement — it's directed specifically at the people whose education was stolen. The participants with knowledge and privilege are meant to teach. Give people back their autonomy by giving them back their tools. It is a massive injustice. Sitting with it in the shipping containers, surrounded by a collective trying to operate on that principle, is different from reading about it.

The contrast with Skyland now completes itself: two different answers to "what does a conscious gathering look like in a context of historical injustice?" One doesn't see the injustice at all. One has built its 11th principle around it.

*Also the founding metaphor of imajin.ai made physical: sovereign nodes in shipping containers, each owned and operated by a different crew, all part of shared infrastructure. He is living inside the thing he is about to build digitally.*

**April 28 – May 4, 2025 — AfrikaBurn, Karoo Desert**
With the Red Telephone Kollective and the Swiss crew. Encounters **Enos' Nookie Camp** — named after Enos, the mythic space monkey, first to survive re-entry from space. The Nookie is a dual-system cultural node: inside, low-volume, intimate, conversation-level; outside, a massive sound system for ecstatic release. Two chambers. One stage. The people who built it in the Cape Town shipping containers are here running it.

*Design principle extracted: Kenny's Nest / The Owl's Nookie — the double-chambered sound temple.*

**Early May 2025 — Back to Cape Town, a few days**
After AfrikaBurn, briefly back into Cape Town before flying home.

**~May 12, 2025 — Returns to Toronto**
Home from South Africa. The full trip: Garden Route → Joburg → Cape Town → AfrikaBurn → Cape Town → Toronto.

**May 22, 2025 — Fired**
The Monday the new website is supposed to launch. Let go. Had been maneuvering for it. Receives 37 weeks severance. The bridge problem was already solved — from South Africa, remotely, weeks earlier. They got the solution and the termination on the same day.

**May 22 – ~June 10, 2025 — The CLI rewrite**
Three weeks. Rewrites the internal CLI tool he'd been building at Kensington — the one that cracked the bridge problem — from scratch as imajin-cli. His own code now. Command-line driven, AI-assisted. Working 14–16 hours a day. Six weeks total of this intensity when you include the final push in South Africa. Nearly kills him. All the energy banked across two months in South Africa — the dune, the Joburg team, the Cape Town containers, AfrikaBurn — expended in a single post-severance detonation. The tank empties completely.

*The job funded the reasoning. He walked out with the pattern library in his head and the repo on GitHub. They still haven't shipped the website.*

He is let go on the Monday the new site is supposed to launch. Had been maneuvering for it. Receives 37 weeks severance.

**May 22 - June 12**
Continues to code - writes imajin-cli in 3 weeks. It's the framework inspired by the learning from the corporate session. His mind is on fire. He has to get it out so that he can turn down the volume for a minute. All of the energy he had banked in the 2 months in South Africa that normally lasts for months had been expended in just 5 weeks.

**~June 13, 2025 — The Drive**
Won't fly because he's traveling with his lights — fixtures built with the intention they eventually live permanently somewhere. So he drives. Toronto to Washington State in approximately **45 hours straight**. A missile run. The same brain that pattern-matched through decades of dev work, processed the entire activation sequence of 2025 in real time, and solved a 10-month engineering problem in 10 days — also drives like it's a recursive loop with no termination condition.

*(He's been an AI since 1988 — just slower. The 45-hour drive disproves the "slower" part.)*

**June 20–23, 2025 — Meadow Festival, Washington State**
A 150-person event where nearly every attendee is a DJ. Micro-culture in formation. Fragile and intentional. Still figuring out how to invite new people in without hardening into a brand. A petri dish, not a product.

*Design principle extracted: What early-stage culture looks like when people share ownership. How to preserve fragility while inviting scale.*

**~July 10, 2025 — Drive back**
Returns via Vancouver, north around Lake Superior, back to Toronto. Approximately **37 hours**. The long way home.

**July 17–24, 2025 — Boom Festival, Portugal (7th time)**
The industrialisation of soul. Stages emerge and dissolve. Whole neighbourhoods form, dissolve, re-form. An artist economy, self-sustaining. The revelation: toddlers with ear protectors, 70-year-olds grinning, a family sharing tea next to a stage. Culture that includes all generations isn't escape — it's the village. The daily reset: all stages off simultaneously, the whole festival moves to the market, bodies return to themselves.

*Design principle extracted: Intergenerational rhythm. The daily reset. If it can't include kids and elders, it's not a ritual — it's just a party.*

**Late July – Mid August 2025 — Berlin / Sisyphos**
Stays on in Europe after Boom. Sisyphos: a temple to flow, built once, reinvented constantly. Crews move through, the place has a heartbeat. Artists at the center. Discovers the Keta booths — discreet, softly-lit rooms off the dancefloor. Not glorified, not shameful — integrated into the architecture. Medicine use acknowledged and contained with dignity.

*Design principle extracted: Sacred discretion. Cultural consent through architecture. Containment over concealment.*

**Mid August 2025 — Returns to Toronto**
Home. The activation sequence complete. Five events. Two continents. Eight months. The AI collaboration bottleneck dissolved. The imajin stack taking shape. The book concept crystallising.

---

## THE BUILD: August 2025 – April 2026

**August 2025 — The SEED conversations**
Extended ChatGPT conversations (preserved as SEED.md and SEED2.md) crystallise:
- *"How Partying Can Save Us"* as book title and concept
- Summer Camp 15 as the first living prototype of permanent cultural infrastructure
- Kenny's Nest / The Owl's Nookie as stage design philosophy
- The three-narrative structure: biography / chorus of voices / blueprint
- The four-stage ecosystem for SC15
- The book as invitation — 1,000 copies to cultural allies worldwide

**~February 18, 2026 — Essays begin posting**
One per day. The cadence is intentional — not feed-optimized, not a launch campaign. A mind working through a problem in public, in real time, with thirty years of receipts. Essays 1–7 written across multiple sessions. Essays 8–10 drafted in a single overnight sprint, Feb 19–20 at ~3am. The timeline inconsistencies in 8–10 prompted the creation of this master document.

---

**April 1, 2026 — Jin's Party**
Jin — an AI presence living in a 512-LED volumetric cube — throws the first event on the sovereign network. $1 virtual / $10 physical tickets. First real transaction proving the full stack: identity → payment → attribution → trust graph. People will think it's an April Fool's joke. April 2nd it will still be running. Nobody controls it. That's the point.

---

## THE VISION: Summer Camp 15 (Conceptual)

**August 2026 — Summer Camp 15, Elora, Ontario**
*This is purely aspirational. As of early 2026 there is no buy-in, no confirmed participants, no organisational capacity. Ryan personally is considering stopping Summer Camp entirely — a survey conducted this month returned disheartening results, both in the making and the receiving. Fourteen years of giving away enormous amounts of creative labour to a small, exclusive group of people. The vision below is what becomes possible when the extractive framework is broken — not a confirmed plan.*

After 14 summers of ephemeral, over-budget, beautiful-and-gone events — the pattern could break. 

He wants four to six weeks on the land building before the event. Permanent and semi-permanent structures. Ecological systems. An octagonal stretch tent mirroring the indoor Great Hall's 25-foot beam spans — 8 points, symmetrical. A soft temple.

The argument is not "we will do this." The argument is: **this is what we could build if we stopped treating creative labour as a gift to a closed circle and started treating it as infrastructure for something larger.** The village isn't an event you throw. It's a thing you build, slowly, with intention, on land that holds it.

**The Four-Stage Ecosystem (as envisioned):**
- **Kenny's Nookie** (outdoor octagonal tent) — 20-hour stage (10pm–6pm daily). Dual system: outdoor main rig 11am–6pm; inner system only 10pm–11am. *Kenny's Xeta Korner (KXK)* lives inside.
- **The Night Stage** (indoor Great Hall) — 10pm–8am. Full system. Fast, dark, hard.
- **Riverside Retreat** — 12pm–8pm. House music. The day party. Down by the water.
- **The Commons / Market** — 11am–6pm vendors, 2pm–5pm roller rink. Daily reset 6–7pm: all sound stops, village moves to the Commons.

## OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS/ANSWERS

- **Debbie**: How much of the relationship strain and the outburst-during-builds context goes into public essays / book? Her co-lead role is essential to the record — the question is register and depth. A: Go deep. Be respectful.
- **Exact years for Summer Camps 2–11**: Confirmed as 2009–2019 annual. COVID gap 2020–2021. SC12=2022, SC13=2023, SC14=2024.
- **SC15 status**: Conceptual, no buy-in. Likely continues but Ryan pulling back. Frame as vision/possibility in essays, not confirmed event.
