**Position:** After Essay 22 (How to Save Media Streaming) / Before the Finale

**What this essay does:** Six industries down. The reader has seen extraction named and dismantled six ways. This is the reckoning before the party. Not a systems essay — a gut check. Community fails constantly. It gets weaponized. The word has been so hollowed out that the people who need it most flinch when they hear it. This essay takes that seriously and then makes the case anyway.

**The turn:** Isolated people are captive consumers. That's not a conspiracy — it's the math. The cynicism is reasonable and also exactly what the system wants. The tools now exist to make community something other than a bet on everyone's best behavior.

**Key beats:**
- Open on the eye-roll. "Community" as product. The WeWork lobby. The Discord that tore apart. The camp that became a clique.
- Take the failures seriously. Name them without flinching.
- What the failures had in common: no infrastructure for accountability. No memory that belonged to the group. No way for the community to see itself.
- The people who need this most have been burned the most. The architecture has to earn them back — not ask for faith.
- The extraction model depends on your isolation.
- Close: every culture that has ever existed has had ritual gathering. The question was never whether. It was whether the infrastructure was worthy of the trust.
