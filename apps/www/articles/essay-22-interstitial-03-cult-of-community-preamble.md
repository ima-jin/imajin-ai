The Monday they let me go I went home and opened my laptop.

Thirty-seven weeks of severance. A decade of accumulated pattern library in my head. The sudden terrifying freedom of no structure, no standup, no VP to manage around. I rewrote the CLI tool from scratch. My own code now. Three weeks. Fourteen to sixteen hours a day. The repo has 99 commits. That's what the burn looks like from the outside — clean commits, a working system emerging from nothing.

From the inside I fried my brain.

That's not a metaphor. The neurodivergent brain that had spent thirty years being told it was broken, that had finally found its native language, that had a decade of compressed energy suddenly released with no constraint — it ran until it couldn't run anymore.

And then I had to leave.

Around June 13th I drove from Toronto to Washington State. Forty-five hours, roughly. The long unspooling kind of drive that has no real purpose except to put distance between you and the thing you just did to yourself.

Meadow Festival. A hundred and fifty people, nearly every one of them a DJ. Micro-culture in formation — fragile, intentional, still figuring out how to invite new people in without hardening into a brand. A petri dish, not a product. I set up my lights. People danced. Nobody was optimizing anything.

Then Boom Festival in Portugal. My seventh time. Whole neighbourhoods forming and dissolving across a week. Toddlers with ear protectors. Seventy-year-olds grinning. Families sharing tea next to stages. Once a day all the stages go silent simultaneously and the whole festival moves to the market — a daily reset, collective and unremarkable, happening because that's how it works, not because anyone decided it was a feature.

I'd been watching that pattern for seven years and it finally landed: culture that includes all generations isn't escape. It's the village. The thing we evolved for. The thing platforms were supposed to replace and couldn't, because you cannot replace a village with an interface.

Then Berlin. Then home. August 2025.

Home has been slow. Deliberately, carefully, intentionally slow.

Coffee in the morning. Some reading. Code for a few hours. Stop when it stops feeling good. Walk. Write when the writing comes. Sleep at a reasonable hour.

For someone who spent thirty years in the burn model this felt like failure for a long time. The April 1st deadline is real. The mortgage is real. Everything argues for urgency.

But I've been to the end of urgency. My previous stretches lasted ten days, fourteen days maximum before the crash. This one has been going since August. Six months. Every day. Without a crash.

The crash is not proof you're serious. It's proof the architecture is wrong.

The right architecture sustains you. And I didn't figure that out alone — I saw it demonstrated by communities that have been running sustainable culture for decades. The village at Boom. The shipping container crews in Cape Town, each node sovereign, no landlord, value flowing to the people doing the work, running AfrikaBurn's 11th principle: *each one teach one*. Not an abstract value statement. A design principle with real stakes, practiced in community, already working before anyone wrote software to encode it.

The burn was the extraction model eating the alternative infrastructure from the inside. The voice that says *do more, move faster, prove it now* — that's the same voice that runs the standup and the all-hands and the performance review. It followed me home. It followed me into the thing I was building to get away from it.

The reset was finding the actual architecture. The one that doesn't require destroying yourself to keep running. I didn't invent it. I recovered it — from communities that already knew.

That's what the software is for. Not to replace these communities. To give them infrastructure as durable as they are.
