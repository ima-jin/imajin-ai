description: "Everything is derivative of something else. The problem was never copying — it was collapsing the chain of who contributed what. .fair preserves the chain. The cultural shift from extraction to attribution repairs a huge wrong."

<!-- STUB — Essay 24

The arc:
- Everything is derivative. Always has been. That's not the problem.
- The problem is the collapse of the attribution chain. Spotify, Facebook, AI training — same mechanism, different scales.
- .fair doesn't try to lock things down. It preserves the chain through every transformation.
- The cultural shift: from "how do I protect my content" to "how do I use tools that carry my contribution forward."
- When attribution flows, value flows. Repair the chain, repair the economics.
- You don't ban the behavior. You make the honest path more rewarding than the dishonest one.

Follows 23 (professional shielding): the mechanism of responsible practice IS attribution preservation.
