You know the group I'm talking about.

Maybe it's a crew you've had since your twenties. Maybe it's the people from that job, that city, that scene. Maybe it's the family group chat that quietly went toxic and nobody will name it. Maybe it's the community you used to feel held by that somehow just... dissolved.

Or maybe — and this is the part nobody talks about — you never got to have it at all. The third spaces closed before you got there. The platforms that replaced them turned out to be stages, not rooms. You have followers. You eat dinner alone.

We are living through the loneliness epidemic in real time. Not as metaphor. As documented, measurable, accelerating fact. The infrastructure for forming community was quietly removed and replaced with something that looked like community from a distance but felt like performance up close.

You can have a thousand connections and no one who shows up.

## The Good Times Gang

My version of the story has a name. Kenny gave it to us around 2007. It stuck the way good names stick — not because anyone voted on it, but because it was true. We were people who knew how to have a good time together. Nightclubs all over Toronto. Then Vancouver. Then wherever any of us ended up. A few hundred at the edges, a hundred and fifty in the core. High-functioning, most of us — a lot of spectrum people, a lot of pattern recognizers, a lot of people who had found each other in the specific way that people find each other when the room is right and the music is good and something clicks.

We've been to each other's weddings. We've watched each other's kids grow up. We've held each other through losses. We've shown up at cottages and on dancefloors and in hospital waiting rooms. For more than twenty-five years, across Toronto and Vancouver and New York and scattered everywhere else, we've been the people who show up for each other.

That's not nothing. That's the most important thing.

This is written from inside that love. It is not a verdict. It is an accounting — honest, because you deserve honesty — of what happened, and why I think the tools we've been building matter to people like us.

## The Infrastructure We Were Given

For most of our existence as a group we lived on Facebook. Then Instagram. Then scattered across WhatsApp threads and iMessage groups and a Discord that most people couldn't tolerate for reasons nobody could quite articulate but everyone felt.

I tried to move us, more than once. It never fully worked. Not because the people didn't want to connect — they did, they do — but because the platforms had already shaped how we communicated. The feed had become the group. The algorithm had become the culture.

That was not an accident.

The platforms we were given were not designed to help communities survive hard moments. They were designed to maximize engagement. Those are not the same thing. Engagement optimizes for what keeps you looking at the screen. Survival optimizes for what keeps you in relationship when the relationship is difficult.

Those two things are almost perfectly opposed.

A platform that profits from your attention has no incentive to give you neutral ground for repair. No incentive to slow things down when the fast-moving dynamics of a group chat are doing damage. Every incentive to let the loudest voices dominate, to let performance substitute for presence, to let the appearance of connection replace the actual work of it.

We were not given the tools we needed. And we were actively kept from building our own — not through conspiracy, but through the more mundane mechanism of capture. Everyone already on the platform. Everyone's history already there. The switching cost too high. The alternative not yet built.

## What Platforms Do to Groups Like Ours

There is a specific thing that happens to communities inside the extraction economy.

The people with the most social capital — the ones at the center of the network, the ones who have been there longest, whose connections are most dense — become the most insulated from the consequences of how they use that capital. Not because they are bad people. Because the infrastructure makes them so.

On a platform, your standing doesn't decline because your judgment got worse. Your follower count doesn't drop because you stopped listening. The feedback loop that would exist in a healthy human community — the one where the people closest to you notice drift and come talk to you — gets interrupted. Not by malice. By architecture. The platform is between you and the signal.

And so behaviour that would have been checked in a community with real infrastructure — where accountability was visible, where the vouch carried weight, where the people doing harm could see the harm they were doing — accumulates instead. Slowly. Until it isn't slow anymore.

We learned the extraction model from the platforms we inhabited. The platforms learned it from the companies that built them to extract from us. I am not absolving anyone. Behaviour is behaviour and it causes real harm. But the system that trained us is worth naming, because understanding it is the first step toward choosing differently.

## What It Means to Be Seen

Here is what the old third spaces gave us that the platforms never could.

You could *see* each other.

Not the curated version. Not the highlight reel or the hot take or the engagement-optimized post. The actual person, in a room, over time. You saw who showed up when it mattered. You saw who disappeared when things got hard. You saw who held the group together and who quietly drained it. The community was legible to itself.

That legibility is what made accountability possible. Not surveillance. Not judgment. Just — you could see the shape of things. Who vouched for whom. Who the trust actually ran through. What the group actually valued versus what it said it valued.

Platforms make that impossible by design. The feed is flat. Everyone performs to the same audience. The actual texture of the relationships — who the real connectors are, where the real trust lives, who has been carrying the weight for years without recognition — disappears into the algorithm.

## What We Didn't Honor

There's another failure underneath the platform failure. One I think about more, because it's ours.

The Good Times Gang was full of makers. DJs, producers, photographers, lighting designers, event organizers, visual artists, builders of all kinds. People who put real creative work into the culture we shared — who made the rooms we danced in, who shaped the sound, who showed up every time with something they'd built.

And we didn't have a culture of honoring that.

Not because we didn't care. Because we didn't have language for it, and we didn't have infrastructure for it. The contribution dissolved into the vibe. The person who held the room together for years got the same credit as the person who showed up twice. The DJ who read the room perfectly at 4am, the photographer whose shots became the memory of the night, the organizer who absorbed a thousand invisible logistics so everyone else could be present — all of it just... flowed into the shared experience and disappeared.

On a platform, there's no mechanism to say: this person made this, and it mattered, and they should be recognized and compensated for it. The platform takes the creative output, serves it as content, and the maker gets a like. The attribution chain collapses at the point of upload. The value flows up, not back.

We inherited that culture. We practiced it on each other. And some of the damage in that community — the specific bitterness that accumulates when people give and give and feel invisible — came from that gap. Not from bad intentions. From the absence of any infrastructure that made contribution legible.

That's the problem .fair is designed to solve. Not just for music or journalism — for this. For the room. For the person who built the thing that made the moment possible and has nothing to show for it.

## Everyone Is the Good Times Gang

I started this with my group. I want to end it with yours.

Because you have one. Or you had one. Or you've been trying to build one and hitting walls everywhere — no third spaces, no neutral ground, no infrastructure that doesn't extract from you the moment you try to use it to connect.

Every crew that went quiet. Every community that dissolved into a group chat. Every organizer who burned out trying to hold people together on platforms designed to pull them apart. Every maker who poured something real into a room and watched it get consumed without credit.

That's the extraction model at work. And it did it to all of us, systematically, for thirty years.

The name "Good Times Gang" is Kenny's. But the thing it names belongs to everyone who has ever found their people and then watched the infrastructure fail them.

The infrastructure that doesn't fail you is what comes next.
