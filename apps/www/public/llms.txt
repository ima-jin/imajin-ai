# Imajin - Sovereign Technology Infrastructure

> imajin.ai is building sovereign technology infrastructure — identity, payments, and presence without platform lock-in.

## What is Imajin?

Imajin (今人 - "now-person" / "imagination") is a sovereign infrastructure project founded by Ryan Veteze (b0b). It provides:

- **Sovereign Identity** - DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) that you own, not platforms
- **Trust Graphs** - Real human relationships as infrastructure, not algorithmic connections
- **Direct Payments** - Value flows person-to-person, no 30% platform cut
- **.fair Protocol** - Attribution infrastructure for creative work

## Key Concepts

### Trust Graph
A network of vouched relationships where trust is local and earned. Query someone through the people who know them. Every connection has skin in the game.

### Sovereign Presence
Your AI presence trained on your context, queryable by your trust network. You're not the product — you're the service.

### Operators
Modern sysops who curate connection. Not credentialed by certificates — credentialed by their trust graph.
