## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Time crunch | High | Ruthless prioritization, cut connections/chat |
| Integration complexity | Medium | Test each service independently first |
| Stripe production setup | Medium | Apply for production access early |
| Hardware (Jin's Pi) | Medium | Can demo on Ryan's hardware if needed |
| Virtual space (Unreal) | Low | Nice to have, not required |

---

## Next Actions

1. [ ] Scaffold profile service
2. [ ] Scaffold events service
3. [ ] Verify auth handles agent type
4. [ ] Test pay checkout flow standalone
5. [ ] Create Jin's DID (genesis agent)
