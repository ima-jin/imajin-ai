# I'm Sorry I Couldn't Explain

## December 2024

I got my autism diagnosis in December 2024. I was 49 years old.

Fourteen months ago. And I'm a slow thinker — not in the way people mean when they say that as an insult, but in the way that connections surface on their own timeline, not mine. I can't force them. I just have to wait.

I'm still circling this one. Probably will be for a while.

This essay is an attempt to explain something I've never been able to explain before. Not because I didn't want to. Because I didn't have the framework.

## The Pattern I Couldn't Name

From the earliest I can remember, I would sit and focus on a thing until I could get it to work.

Not learning it. Not understanding it in any formal sense. Just staring at the problem. Testing permutations. Endlessly. Switching. Adapting. Waiting for the aha.

Family members would become concerned. Hours. Sometimes whole days. Locked onto a single thing.

Mostly I was calm. Absorbed. Unreachable.

When it worked, it felt like the most natural thing in the world. When it didn't, the frustration was rare but intense. Not scary. But off-putting to people who didn't understand what was happening inside me.

My family accepted it as part of me. They didn't have language for it either.

Neither did I. Until December 2024.

## A Career Built On Pattern Recognition

I learned to code by copying programs out of magazines.

Line by line. Character by character. BASIC programs from Compute! and RUN magazine into my Commodore 64, not understanding what any of it did, just following the pattern on the page. Run it. See if it works. Compare to the source if it doesn't. Fix it. Run it again.

I tried college for six months. Couldn't handle it. Too abstract. Too disconnected from actually making things work.

Instead I got good at finding working patterns and adapting them. Reading forums obsessively. Finding code that solved problems shaped like mine. Copying it. Running it. Adjusting until it clicked.

I could build entire systems this way. I couldn't always explain why they worked. I couldn't structure them from scratch without finding a pattern to start from. I needed someone to walk me through the first few steps of a new stack before my brain could orient itself and take over.

For decades I thought this made me a lesser developer.

The diagnosis reframed it: I was already operating the way AI works. Pattern recognition. Iteration. Context matching across domains. Working pragmatically toward solutions without requiring complete theoretical understanding first.

I wasn't a bad developer who couldn't learn the right way. I was a different kind of intelligence that the industry didn't have a name for yet.

## The Cost of Not Knowing

Here's what I couldn't see at the time:

When I go deep into a build, I manifest. That's the word I use for it — extended periods of intense focus without breaks. Hours and hours of staring, testing, switching, adapting. The work absorbs everything. I become unreachable.

And I didn't know how to warn people. I didn't know how to set expectations. I didn't know how to surface for air at regular intervals because I wasn't aware there was a problem with going that deep.

There have been moments in my life when I've made pivotal changes I couldn't explain. Quick exits from jobs. Life decisions that seemed to come from nowhere. Rare, but seismic. Not explosive anger — more like: I've been building pressure I didn't know was there, and suddenly I know exactly what I have to do next, and I can't explain it to anyone, and I have to do it right now.

Each time, people were caught off guard.

Each time, I went looking for better tools to understand myself.

## The Work I've Done

After traveling for a year in 2004, I came back different.

In 2010 I did the Hoffman Process. People who knew me before that say I'm quite zen and chill now by comparison. I believe them. That work changed something fundamental.

After that, different therapists over the years. Trying to understand the patterns. Getting closer each time but never quite having the right framework.

Then December 2024. Autism. ADHD. A diagnosis that made 49 years of my life suddenly make sense.

I'm not listing this to perform growth. I'm listing it because I think it matters that the outbursts were always followed by genuine reflection. The ruptures weren't the whole story. What came after them was also real.

## What AI Changed

Last year I traveled to Johannesburg to sit with a dev team as an observer. They were using modern AI-assisted tools — the kind I'd avoided because I could never memorize command-line syntax.

Watching them work, something clicked.

When I got back, I built something that a dev on our team had been stuck on for months. A bridge between a legacy system I knew intimately and a new stack I'd barely touched.

I built it in ten days.

AI handled the first steps — the initial scaffold, the syntax I couldn't memorize, the parts that required holding too much formal knowledge at once. I brought the pattern recognition, the systems thinking, the understanding of how the domains needed to connect.

It was the first time in my career I didn't need another person to get me past the initial threshold of a new stack.

The same mechanism I'd used since 1985 — copy, iterate, recognize patterns, adapt — finally had the right collaborator.

## How I See

My neurotype is such that I can see the deep future and I know the very next step to get there.

The middle is a blur.

I know I need to move away from Toronto. I know what I'm building with imajin.ai and why it matters. I know the April 1st launch date is right. I know the next step.

But I can't show you the whole path. Not because I'm being evasive. Because I genuinely can't see it yet. The middle bits emerge as I move through them, often with the help of people who can fill in what I can't.

This has always been true. I couldn't explain it before. I'm trying to explain it now.

Most people need to see the whole path before they can trust the destination. I understand why. Living with someone who can only see the next step — who makes major moves without being able to justify the full route — requires a kind of trust that isn't easy to give.

I know I've asked for a lot of it.

## The Apology

I'm sorry for the times I went unreachable inside a project when people needed me present.

I'm sorry for the pivotal changes that came without enough warning or explanation.

I'm sorry for asking you to trust a destination I couldn't describe to you.

I'm sorry it took 49 years to have the framework to even begin explaining this.

I'm not sorry for how I'm wired. I've made peace with that. But I am genuinely sorry for the hurt that came from not understanding it sooner — and for the hurt caused to people who deserved better navigation from me through those moments.

## The Invitation

The diagnosis, the AI tools, and the writing I'm doing now are all part of the same thing: finally building the language for how I work.

If you're in my life and you've wondered why I make the moves I make, why I can't always explain the path, why I sometimes go somewhere no one else can follow yet — this is the best explanation I have so far.

I'm not done figuring it out. The connections are still surfacing.

But if you have capacity to be curious about what I'm going through rather than alarmed by it, I'd welcome that. Ask me what I need. Tell me what you need. I'm genuinely better at this than I used to be.

I'm built for deep thinking. Not everything. Deep, sustained focus on complex systems and patterns that need translating into something useful. That's the wiring.

AI is helping me see the murky middle better. These essays are part of that too.

The tools finally match the brain.

Now we build.
